# PROJECT IS ONLY HOSTED LOCALLY

after hosting the project on [store.ledraa.com](https://store.ledraa.com) and allowing users to edit it on admin.ledraa.com the project overwhelmed the payment proccessor "lemonsqueezy" and the database which resulted into the store having a constant error when trying to access it thus i will be making the source code public but without hosting it you still can try it and host it locally.
